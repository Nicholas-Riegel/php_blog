# PHP BLOG LEARNING / TEACHING TOOL

This project is deliberately unstyled.

I felt that many Object Oriented PHP tutorials are overly complex and spend too much time on CSS and styling. 

This project was created to focus more on the code than the UI.

The goal is to make an learning application that exemplifies
* Object Oriented PHP
* Sessions
* Authentication
* MVC
* CRUD
* SQL Database

with as little code as possible.

The SQL queries for making the tables are in the db.sql file
