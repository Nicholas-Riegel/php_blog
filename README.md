# PHP BLOG LEARNING / TEACHING TOOL

This project only has minimal styling at the moment.

The goal is to make an learning application that exemplifies
* Object Oriented PHP
* Sessions
* Authentication
* MVC
* CRUD
* SQL Database

with as little code as possible.

The SQL queries for making the tables are in the db.sql file

1. Change URL_ROOT in ./config/config.php
2. Change DB credentials in ./Libraries/Database.php
3. run php -S localhost:[URL_ROOT domain]
