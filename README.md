# PHP BLOG LEARNING / TEACHING TOOL

This project is deliberately unstyled.

I feel that many of the Object Oriented PHP tutorials online are overly complex and spend far too much time on CSS and styling. 

This project was created to focus more on the code than the UI.

* Object Oriented PHP
* Sessions
* Authentification
* MVC
* CRUD
* SQL Database
with as little code as possible.

The SQL queries for making the tables are in the db.sql file
