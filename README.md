# PHP BLOG

The goal is to make a vanilla PHP application that exemplifies

* Object Oriented PHP
* Sessions
* Authentication
* Front and backend Validation
* MVC
* CRUD
* SQL Database

The SQL queries for making the tables are in the db.sql file

The project may be viewed at https://php-sessions-oop.herokuapp.com/

For development:

1. Change URL_ROOT in ./config/config.php
2. Change DB credentials in ./Libraries/Database.php
3. run php -S localhost:[URL_ROOT domain]
